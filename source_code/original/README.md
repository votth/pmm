A michaelis menten enzyme kinetics R Shiny app for the [Coursera data products course](https://class.coursera.org/devdataprod-033).

App is available on [shinyapps.io](https://stevecheckley.shinyapps.io/shiny_mm)

### Summary
This app simulates the modifications a scientist can make to the attributes of an enzyme and reports the rate of product formation ([P]), substrate utilization [S] and information about the amount of free enzyle [E] complexed with substrate [ES]. You can also adjust the starting amount of enzyme and substrate The calculations are the same as those performed daily by enzyme kineticists the world over, and apps such as this are useful experimental tools.
